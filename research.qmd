    <p>We study a setting in which a privately informed supplier must secure a publicly observed license from a monopolist before selling to a private-value buyer. Licensing fees, tied to subsequent sale terms, optimally take the form of royalties which impose penalties at low prices and which may be negative at high prices to enforce price-maintenance and screen the buyer, yielding allocations equivalent to second-degree price discrimination. Licensing’s welfare impact is ambiguous — it can reduce buyer-driven deadweight loss but introduce supplier inefficiencies. Applied to exclusive-dealing, our model shows such contracts can <em>enhance</em> aggregate welfare, contrary to Aghion &amp; Bolton (1987).</p>

### Hierarchies of Belief Types in Games with Many Players

    <p>Following Mertens &amp; Zamir (1985) and Brandenburger &amp; Dekel (1993), universal type spaces have been constructed for each player in a general <em>n</em>-player game of incomplete information, where types encode hierarchies of beliefs. We introduce an analogous construction for games with a <em>continuum</em> of players indexed by the Lebesgue unit interval. For each player, belief types correspond to joint probability measures over triples consisting of (i) the player’s label, (ii) a non-belief type given by a cardinal equivalence class of payoff functions, and (iii) a recursively constructed hierarchy of belief types. The marginal over player labels must equal Lebesgue measure.</p>

      <p><em>Mertens and Zamir (1985) first provided the universal type space construction for finite
player games of incomplete information with a compact state space. Brandenburger and
Dekel (1993) complemented it for a Polish state space. This paper extends the construction
of Brandenburger and Dekel (1993) to games with infinitely many players for Harsanyi’s
notion of a type. The extension is formulated by randomly drawing a countably infinite
set of actual players from a continuum of potential players, represented by their labels in
[0,1]. The random distribution of the countably infinite set of actual players almost surely
converges to Lebesgue due to the Glivenko–Cantelli theorem. A coherent type is shown
to induce beliefs over other player’s types and common knowledge of coherency closes the
model of beliefs. Implications of dropping the Polish space assumption are discussed and
an informal extension to measurable spaces is provided for future work. The formalisation
provided here allows Harsanyi’s notion of Type.</em></p>

      <p>Current estimates of child labour often rely on questions such as, “How many hours did you work last week?” While biases in adult self-reports are well-documented in high-income countries, there is limited evidence on the accuracy of children's responses in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Using data from nine LMICs, including China and India, this paper shows that time diaries report more than twice as many work hours as standard questionnaires. This discrepancy suggests that current estimates may significantly understate child labour. Moreover, certain forms of work—such as collecting water or firewood—appear to contribute to these measurement gaps.</p>
