Brandenburger and\nDekel (1993) complemented it for a Polish state space. This paper extends the construction\nof Brandenburger and Dekel (1993) to games with infinitely many players for Harsanyi’s\nnotion of a type. The extension is formulated by randomly drawing a countably infinite\nset of actual players from a continuum of potential players, represented by their labels in\n[0,1]. The random distribution of the countably infinite set of actual players almost surely\nconverges to Lebesgue due to the Glivenko–Cantelli theorem. A coherent type is shown\nto induce beliefs over other player’s types and common knowledge of coherency closes the\nmodel of beliefs. Implications of dropping the Polish space assumption are discussed and\nan informal extension to measurable spaces is provided for future work. The formalisation\nprovided here allows Harsanyi’s notion of Type.\n    \n  \n\n  \n  PDF\n\n\n\nEstimating How Much Children Work: Questionnaires vs Time Use Diaries\n\nwith Juana Lamote de Grignon Pérez, Federico Blanco Allais, Wenbin Wang, Matthew Henglong Luo, Jialu Tang\n\n\nJournal of Development Economics (conditionally accepted, 2025).\n\n\n  \n    Abstract\n    \n      Current estimates of child labour often rely on questions such as, “How many hours did you work last week?” While biases in adult self-reports are well-documented in high-income countries, there is limited evidence on the accuracy of children's responses in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Using data from nine LMICs, including China and India, this paper shows that time diaries report more than twice as many work hours as standard questionnaires. This discrepancy suggests that current estimates may significantly understate child labour. Moreover, certain forms of work—such as collecting water or firewood—appear to contribute to these measurement gaps.",
